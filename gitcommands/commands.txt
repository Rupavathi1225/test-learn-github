to clone a repository click on code ssh then copy the url and paste it in the command prompt
$ git clone <ssh url>

Before starting actual development always create a feature branch from the main
checkout to main branch
$ git checkout origin/main

pull latest changes from the main
$ git pull origin main

now create a feature branch from the main branch
$ git checkout -b rupa-feat.learn_git (nothing but branch name)

to check what is your current branch
$ git branch

Do your work and create/modify the files
then to check the what chnages you made
$ git status
it will show you what changes you made in red colour

$ git add <file name?> # make sure to replace the filename and brackets with the desired file

to commit your changes to the branch
$ git commit -m "message for my commit" # write some meaningful message

now push your changes to your feature branch

$ git push origin <feature-branch> # make sure to replace feature-branch with the branch name whic you have created earlier in the line number 12

Boom thats it you will get a link in tyhe command prompt copy and paste it in the browser and create a pull request
Note: Here make sure you are creating pull request to the correct branch in our local we are directly creating to main
      but in companies we need to go to dev >> qa >> uat >> prod
